Windows Environment Variables Editor

This is a project under development. And I am too busy and too lazy to document it. 
Well, I promise I will clean up the code and documentations. But, not today.

If you are interested, let me know.

# Update 2016-09-14
Now Windows 10 already has built-in interface to change system variables.
